# About myself 
I am a theoretical ecologist. I build mathematical and statistical models and combine analytical methods with numerical simulations to solve problems in ecology. My research experience is focused on symbiotic interactions, but I have broad interests ranging from population dynamics and epidemiology to medical applications.

I am a member of the Hurford and Dufour labs at Memorial University. Contact me at:
