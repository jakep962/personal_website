I build mathematical and statistical models to model population dynamics and make long-term predictions for salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis My research experience is focused on the impact of environmental conditions, but I have broad interests ranging from population dynamics, ecosystem modeling and epidemiology to medical applications.

Here, I studied Marine Biology and discovered my interest in statistics and mathematics. Realizing this, I applied my time at UNB to understand how a species environmental conditions can be used to make predictions about interactions, abundances and population dynamics. Under the supervisor of Dr. Jeff Houlahan, my undergraduate honours thesis investigated how random forest and boosted tree models could predict bird abundances within the United States of America based on land-use data. Through UNB, I was able to participate in the UNB Marine Semester. Based at the Huntsman Marine Science Centre (HMSC) in St. Andrews, the Marine Fall Semester is an intensive, 12-week immersion program in a marine setting. It provides students with hands-on study experience of diverse marine organisms, including mammals (whales and seals), algae, fish and invertebrates. Through this program, I investigated how wave and ocean current data could be used to identify sub-populations of dog whelk Nucella lapillus and periwinkle Littorina littorea within the Bay of Fundy.

My work uses a stochastic discrete-time population model to explore outcomes of a theoretical population to various salinity scenarios in Bay D’Espoir, Newfoundland. I’m hoping to have my first chapter published soon!

Aquafort AI is an aquaculture technology company aiming to transform the global aquaculture production process and fortify global food security. As their Marine Biologist intern, I’ve performed literature reviews, consulted on general biological processes and topics, and contact various organizations. Biology Department of Memorial University’s Quantitative Skills for Biology Guide As more biology-relevant skills become easily performed using computers (statistical analyses, mathematical modelling, managing and reformatting data, etc.) Memorial University is increasing the focus of quantitative skills and best practices throughout its Biology curriculum. As quantitative skills are introduced into various classes, as part of a team, I have contributed to creating the Quantiative skills for biology guide and several specific course bookdown websites (Principles of Biology BIOL 1001 &amp; BIOL1002, Ecology).
