**Aquafort AI Marine Biologist Intern**

Starting in late 2020, I acted as the Marine Biologist Intern for the Newfoundland-based tech startup [Aquafort AI](https://aquafort.ai/). Aquafort AI is an aquaculture technology company aiming to transform the global aquaculture production process and fortify global food security. As their Marine Biologist intern, I've performed literature reviews, consulted on general biological processes and topics, and contact various organizations.
